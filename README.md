# global_path_autocomplete
sublime text package for autocompletion of all file paths

## OS:
   - Linux: works
   - MacOS: (Untested) might work
   - Windoze: (Untested) probably won't work (doesn't check for `C:` or `\`)

## known issues:
  - doesn't initialize drop down menu so some other plugin has to suggest something first
  - breaks on file names with spaces in them
  - doesn't work if file path starts at the beginning of the line
